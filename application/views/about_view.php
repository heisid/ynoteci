<h2>About Y-Note</h2>

<p>Y-Note is stupidly simple note taking website: write a formatted note, read, edit, and delete. No unnecessary fuss you barely care. That's what I say. But you know the truth: it's simply because I'm a novice.</p>
<p>Y-Note is created using these stuffs:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://codeigniter.com" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a> framework on top of <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> programming language.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ckeditor.com/" target="_blank">CKEditor</a> as its rich text editor, I'm too lazy to make my own. Even I didn't make any customization.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. Nothing fancy.</p>
